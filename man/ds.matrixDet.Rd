\usage{
ds.matrixDet(M1 = NULL, newobj = NULL, logarithm = FALSE,
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{M1}{A character string specifying the name of the matrix for which
determinant to be calculated}

\item{newobj}{A character string specifying the name of the matrix to which the output
is to be written. If no <newobj> argument is specified, the output matrix names defaults
to "M1_det" where <M1> is the first argument of the function}

\item{logarithm}{logical. Default is FALSE, which returns the
determinant itself, TRUE returns the logarithm of the modulus of the determinant.}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the <datasources>
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
{ds.setDefaultOpals.o}. If the <datasources> is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]}
}
\value{
the calculated determinant of the matrix as a serverside object
with its name specified by the <newobj> argument (or default name <M1>_det).
The determinant is reported as a two component list. Element 1
is $modulus and element 2 is $sign. If logarithm=FALSE: $modulus reports the
absolute value of the determinant and is therefore always positive. $sign 
indicates whether the determinant is positive ($sign=1) or negative ($sign=-1).
$modulus has an attribute [attr(,"logarithm")] which is FALSE if the argument
<logarithm> was FALSE - this enables you to look at results post-hoc to determine
whether the logarithm argument was TRUE or FALSE. If you wish to generate the
actual determinant if logarithm=FALSE it is easiest to calculate $modulus*$sign.   
If logarithm=TRUE: $modulus reports the log (to base e) of the absolute value
of the determinant. $sign again reports whether the determinant is positive
($sign=1) or negative ($sign=-1). The attribute of $modulus [attr(,"logarithm")]
is now TRUE. If you wish to generate the actual determinant when logarithm=TRUE
you calculate exp($modulus)*$sign. In addition to the calculated matrix
determinant, two validity messages are also returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.matrixDet also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message.o}
function. If you type ds.message.o("newobj") it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message.o("newobj")
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".

\description{
Calculates the determinant of a square matrix A 
and writes it as a data object to the serverside
}
\details{
Calculates the determinant of a square matrix (for additional
information see help for {determinant} function in native R). This operation is only
possible if the number of columns and rows of A are the same.
