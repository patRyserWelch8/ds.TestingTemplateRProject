\title{ds.matrixDimnames calling assign function matrixDimnamesDS}
\usage{
ds.matrixDimnames(M1 = NULL, dimnames = NULL, newobj = NULL,
  datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{M1}{Specifies the name of the serverside matrix to which
dimnames are to be added. Specified as a character string in
inverted commas: e.g. M1="matrix.name"}

\item{dimnames}{A dimnames attribute for the matrix: NULL or a list of
length 2 giving
the row and column names respectively. An empty list is treated as NULL,
and a list of length one as row names only. Components in the list can
be specified as character strings (e.g. "a", "name3" or "77"), or numbers
(e.g. 1,-8, 1:10). Examples include:
dimnames=list(c("a","cc","73",8,"h"),c("1","b","d","8","ghhj",1:4)) specifies
the row names and column names for a matrix with 5 rows and 9 columns;
dimnames=list(NULL,c("1","b","d","8","ghhj",1:4)) specifies just
the column names for a matrix with 9 columns;
dimnames=list(c("a","cc","73",8,"h"),NULL) specifies just
the row names for a matrix with 5 rows.}

\item{newobj}{A character string specifying the name of the matrix to which the output
is to be written. If no <newobj> argument is specified or it is NULL
the output matrix names defaults to "<M1>_dimnames" where <M1> is the matrix
name specified by the <M1> argument}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the <datasources>
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
{ds.setDefaultOpals.o}. If the <datasources> is to be specified, it should be set without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or default name "<M1>_dimnames")
which is written to the serverside. In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study - e.g. because
a disclosure trap was tripped and creation of the full output object was blocked -
ds.matrixDimnames also returns any studysideMessages that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message.o}
function. If you type ds.message.o("newobj") it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message.o("newobj")
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".

Adds dimnames (row names, column names or both) to
a matrix on the serverside.

\details{
Adds dimnames (row names, column names or both) to
a matrix on the serverside. Similar to the {dimnames} function
in native R.
