\title{ds.asList.o calling aggregate function asListDS.o}
\usage{
ds.asList.o(x.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.name}{the name of the input object to be coerced to class
list. Must be specified in inverted commas e.g. x.name="input.object.name"}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new output variable. If this argument is set
to NULL, the name of the new variable is defaulted to <x.name>.list}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the <datasources>
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
{ds.setDefaultOpals.o}. If an explicit <datasources> argument is to be set,
it should be specified without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or by default <x.name>.list
if the <newobj> argument is NULL) which is written to the serverside.
In addition, two validity messages are returned. The first confirms an output
object has been created, the second states its class. The way that {as.list}
coerces objects to list depends on the class of the object, but in general
the class of the output object should usually be 'list'
}
\description{
this function is based on the native R function {as.list}
}
\details{
See details of the native R function {as.list}.
Unlike most other class coercing functions the serverside function
that is called is an aggregate function rather than an assign function.
This is because the {datashield.assign} function in opal deals
specially with a created object (<newobj>) if it is of class list.
Reconfiguring the function as an aggregate function
works around this problem.
