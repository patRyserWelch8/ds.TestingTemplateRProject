\title{ds.asMatrix.o calling assign function asMatrixDS.o}
\usage{
ds.asMatrix.o(x.name = NULL, newobj = NULL, datasources = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.name}{the name of the input object to be coerced to a matrix.
Must be specified in inverted commas.}

\item{newobj}{the name of the new output variable. If this argument is set
to NULL, the name of the new variable is defaulted to <x.name>.mat}

\item{datasources}{specifies the particular opal object(s) to use. If the <datasources>
argument is not specified the default set of opals will be used. The default opals
are called default.opals and the default can be set using the function
{ds.setDefaultOpals.o}. If an explicit <datasources> argument is to be set,
it should be specified without
inverted commas: e.g. datasources=opals.em or datasources=default.opals. If you wish to
apply the function solely to e.g. the second opal server in a set of three,
the argument can be specified as: e.g. datasources=opals.em[2].
If you wish to specify the first and third opal servers in a set you specify:
e.g. datasources=opals.em[c(1,3)]}
}
\value{
the object specified by the <newobj> argument (or by default <x.name>.mat
if the <newobj> argument is NULL) which is written to the serverside.
In addition, two validity messages are returned
indicating whether <newobj> has been created in each data source and if so whether
it is in a valid form. If its form is not valid in at least one study there may
be a studysideMessage that can explain the error in creating
the full output object. As well as appearing on the screen at run time,if you wish to
see the relevant studysideMessages at a later date you can use the {ds.message.o}
function. If you type ds.message.o(<newobj>) it will print out the relevant
studysideMessage from any datasource in which there was an error in creating <newobj>
and a studysideMessage was saved. If there was no error and <newobj> was created
without problems no studysideMessage will have been saved and ds.message.o(<newobj>)
will return the message: "ALL OK: there are no studysideMessage(s) on this datasource".

\description{
this function is based on the native R function {as.matrix}
}
\details{
This function is based on the native R function {as.matrix}
If applied to a data.frame, the native R function {as.matrix}
converts all columns into character class. If you wish to convert
a data.frame to a matrix but maintain all data columns in their
original class you should use the native R function {data.matrix}
and in DataSHIELD this is called by ds.asDataMatrix.o which calls
asDataMatrixDS.o
